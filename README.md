# Ride Share PyBer Analysis

### Goal
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In this project, I played the role of analyzing all of the rideshare data in 2019, and created visual aids such as pie, line, scatter, and bar charts to help visualize the data results more clearly.
### Results of Analysis

While rural areas are the least active in comparison to cities, they bring in more income on individual rides due to long distance trips, since destinations are more spaced out in rural areas. 

However, cities still brought in the majority of the income due to much highter ride activity, due to the highter populations in cities compares to rural areas. 

### Recommendations
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. A promotion to be put in place for riders in urban areas, such as a discount for a certain number of miles. This encourages people to take longer rides and therefore increase profits. 
2. Drivers can be rewarded in some way for accepting longer, more profitable rides. This would encourage drivers to accept long-distance rides and therefore increase profits as well. 
3. More analyses can be done on quality of rides and drivers to imrpove the overall use of ride services provided by this company.
